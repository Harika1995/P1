44663 P1 assignment


At the Starting of my assignment I have created a Repository in my github account and named it as the P1. I have clone that assignment and copied it into my local repository. 

In the Power shell 
1. run with the command dontnet new console.
2. dotnet run.

This app is containing the boole, int, double, char, string and decimal type of values.

This app contains the while loop which haves the condition.

My app also contains the selection statments(Switch) and the branching statments like if and if-else.

Here in my app I have implemented the a static function called public decimal totalCost(string itemNo, int quantity, decimal unitCost). Which is used to calculate the total bill of the customer on which Alcohol the customer has sent.

This Method takes the itemNno, qunatity and unnitCost as a parameters and find the total purchase amount that the customer has buy on the Alcohol.

Finally my app will calculated the totalCost of the customer purchased.

Here in the app it will ask you to enter true to continue or q to quit.
